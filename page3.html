<h2>Trojan Horse Virus</h2>
<p>
A Trojan Horse virus is exactly what it sounds like in allusion to greek history.
A trojan horse virus is a type of malware that downloads onto your computer disguised as a legitimate program. The "legitimate"
program will usually have malware inside that tries to gain access to your data.

<p>To avoid this virus never download from a source you don't trust completely
    Don't open attachments from emails you don't trust either, remember its always better to stay safe than curious.
    If you know software you have downloaded contains a virus delete it immediately, also it's always useful to have antivirus on your computer
